# HyprSetup for Arch

Do not use the `install.sh` scirpt. it isn't updated to work with the chages ive made recently and won't be updated to work. I also use sway now, not Hyprland.

## Useful flags:<b>

`--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll`<b>

`--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland`<b>

`--force-dark-mode`<b>

`--enable-features=WebUIDarkMode`
